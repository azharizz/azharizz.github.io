# Blurring the Lines: Data Engineering Meets DevOps, Software Engineer, and ML 

In data engineering, your work often overlaps with DevOps, software engineering, and machine learning roles. Some companies hire a “full-stack” data engineer who wears all those hats. others split responsibilities into specialized teams. Personally, I love this variety. It’s an opportunity to pick up skills outside the typical data engineering toolkit. Most of these adjacent tasks aren’t as deep or complex as the primary role, but mastering them can position you for broader opportunities. In fact, many data engineers evolve into Solutions Architects at larger organizations by demonstrating cross-functional expertise.

# Growing Beyond Data: DevOps, ML, and Cloud Certifications

While my day-to-day focuses on data pipelines, I’ve also carved out time to learn more about machine learning mainly because several projects required or used it. At the same time, I recognized that DevOps practices are essential for any data pipeline. Whether it’s deploying Airflow on Kubernetes or managing ETL jobs in the cloud. To validate and formalize this knowledge, I earned both the [**AWS Certified Solutions Architect and the Google Cloud Professional Cloud Architect certifications**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Tyf9YvsCY0vfe2GLoy6Cnnns2VR6dE00). Beyond the resume boost, studying for these certificates validated my hands-on experience and pushed me to fill knowledge gaps I hadn’t even realized I had.
